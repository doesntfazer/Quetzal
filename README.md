# Quetzal

100% ergo keyboard based on rp2040 Zero Board

This Keyboard has yet to be tested, Although in it's current state, if you wanted to order boards with the gerber files it should work in theory.

Firmware for this board will be in the \[Keyboard Dweebs Firmware Repository\](https://github.com/doesntfazer/Keyboard-Dweebs-Firmware-repository)

This Board will be using \[PRK Firmware\](https://github.com/picoruby/prk_firmware) because of the support for Japanese duplex Matrices.
